# Space Invaders

I implemented the old arcade _Space Invaders_ usng the _pygame_ library.
This was the first attempt of programming a game in Python, and a chance to see this library, cool though.

There are a few overcomplications I created (unnecessarily, really), but I wanted nonetheless to implement it as a scalable game.
  > Using dictionaries, I started a event handling module for units in the game that is customizable.
  > Many resources are allocated on their first invocation and not on generation, nor on each call
