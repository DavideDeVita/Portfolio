# Triple X

This was a first experiment of C++ coding.
I decided to go with Triple X to allow me to learn the C++ syntax.

This was a really simple program, so I decided to try and create various level generators based on the probability distribution.
  >Higher numbers generate harded levels; therefore the generators would give more chance to the last numbers of the range in order to make the game harder
