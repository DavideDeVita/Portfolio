#ANN with Resilient Back Propagation

This was a University project I worked on alongside two colleagues (S. Falangone, M. Moraca).

It is a Handwritten Digit Classifier implemented through an Artificial NN in Python
  >It uses Resilient Back Propagation (RPROP) to update the weights
  
  >It uses Early Stop Criteria to terminate the training process before it completes all the epoches (and avoid overfitting)
