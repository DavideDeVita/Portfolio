#The aMaze-ing game

This was the very first code of soething resembling a game for me;
I coded it at the beginning of my second year in University, and my skills were, well.. still blossoming.

The project was meant to be a library for data structures handling: Lists, Sets, Heaps, Graphs and Mazes; with an extra implementation of our choice

I never went back cleaning and updating the code yet, but I will definitively re-write the documentation in English (now in Italian)

But most importantly, I will re-develop it in Python 2.7 as soon as I can (with some decent graphic maybe)
