# My Portfolio
I am willing to add here my projects to give a sample of the way I wirte code.
Many of these were Academic Projects and so were written not by myself alone but in team.
Moreover, those required often only to be completed quickly due to the exam date; and might not appear as clean as I would like to
I will try to update them with a better version as soon as I can
