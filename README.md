# My Portfolio

I am willing to add here my projects to give a sample of the way I wirte code.
Many of these were Academic Projects and so were written not alone by myself but in team.
Moreover, those required often only to be completed quickly due to the exam date; and might not appear as clean as I would like to.
I will try to update them with a better version as soon as I can

If a project gets too big I will most likely move it to a dedicated repository (such as HoldClose and Adaptive Pacman)

Here follows a list of the projects you could find here, along with a brief introduction

# Projects

* \[C\] **The aMaze-ing game**
  A handwritten library to manage simple data structures as: _Lists_, _Trees_, _Heaps_, _Graphs_ and _Mazes_
  
  3 game modes implemented (extra implementation of choice)
  > **Standard game**: Go from a tile to another \
  > **Torches game**: Go from a tile to another, but in the dark. Light up the torches you find along the way to help yourself\
  > **Guard game**: Collect all the coins in the maze without being caught by the NPCs. This has 5 levels of difficulty, 2 power-ups, customizable level features and special effects (and it mocks you when you lose.. eh eh!)

* \[Python\] **ANN with Resilient propagation**
  A handwritten digits classifier, implemented as a (parametric) Neural Network.
    >It featured both classic _Back propagation_ and the less common _Resilient back propagation_ studied from a paper.\
    >It also portrayed 3 approaches to _Early stop criteria_ for the training phase (also studied from a paper).

* \[Python\] **Face recognition with eigenfaces**
  A face detection and face recognition computer vision system based on the _eigenfaces_ strategy.

 
* \[Python\] **Space Invaders**
  An old style **Space Invaders** game I made to practice Python and learn about the _pygame_ library.

 
* \[Python\] **Master Mind**
  A digital version of the good and old **Master Mind** game I made to practice with the _pygame_ library.

 
* \[C++\] **TripleX game**
  A simple game I coded to practice C++ for the first time.
  Given how basic it was, I had some fun creating various level generators based on probability distribution!
