Here's a computer version of the good old **Snake**.

Because why not?

This was a rather quick and easy project given the previous two using _pygame_ (**Mastermind** and **Space Invaders**).
    But I am working on a more interesting one: **Tank 90** a.k.a. **Batlle City**

Moreover, it is kinda iconic to code 'Snake' in 'Python'!
